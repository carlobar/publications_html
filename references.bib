abstract = {We study the impact of data sharing policies on cyber insurance markets. These policies have been proposed to address the scarcity of data about cyber threats, which is essential to manage cyber risks. We propose a Cournot duopoly competition model in which two insurers choose the number of policies they offer (i.e., their production level) and also the resources they invest to ensure the quality of data regarding the cost of claims (i.e., the data quality of their production cost). We find that enacting mandatory data sharing sometimes creates situations in which at most one of the two insurers invests in data quality, whereas both insurers would invest when information sharing is not mandatory. This raises concerns about the merits of making data sharing mandatory.},

Designing robust machine learning based attack detection and mitigation algorithms require large amounts of data that rely heavily on a representative environment, where different attacks can be simulated. This paper presents a comprehensive tool-chain for modeling and simulating attacks in power systems. The paper makes the following contributions, first, we present a probabilistic domain specific language to define multiple attack scenarios and simulation configuration parameters. Secondly, we extend the PyPower-dynamics simulator with protection system components to simulate cyber attacks in control and protection layers of power system. In the end, we demonstrate multiple attack scenarios with a case study based on IEEE 39 bus system.},

abstract = {In this work, we study the vulnerabilities of protection systems that can detect cyber-attacks in power grid systems. We show that machine learning-based discriminators are not resilient against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. In particular, we demonstrate that an adversarial actor can launch DoS attacks on specific sensors, render their measurements useless and cause the attack detector to classify a more sophisticated cyber-attack as a normal event. As a result of this, the system operator may fail to take action against attack-related faults leading to a decrease in the operation performance. To realize a DoS attack, we present an optimization problem to determine which sensors to attack within a given budget such that the existing classifier can be deceived. For linear classifiers, this optimization problem can be formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem. In this paper, we extend this optimization problem to find attacks for more complex classifiers such as neural networks. We demonstrate that a neural network, in particular, with RELU activation functions, can be represented as a set of logic formulas using Disjunctive Normal Form, and the optimization problem can be used to efficiently compute a DoS attack. In addition, we propose a defense model that improves the resilience of neural networks against DoS through adversarial training. Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of the approach using a dataset for classification in power systems.},

Blockchains have garnered significant interest from both academia and industry for their potential application in decentralized TES, in large part due to their high level of resilience. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of attacks against blockchain based TES, which target the gateways that connect market participants to the system.

pages={206-212},
abstract={Recent advances in machine learning enable wider applications of prediction models in cyber-physical systems. Smart grids are increasingly using distributed sensor settings for distributed sensor fusion and information processing. Load forecasting systems use these sensors to predict future loads to incorporate into dynamic pricing of power and grid maintenance. However, these inference predictors are highly complex and thus vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Moreover, the adversarial attacks are synthetic norm-bounded modifications to a limited number of sensors that can greatly affect the accuracy of the overall predictor. It can be much cheaper and effective to incorporate elements of security and resilience at the earliest stages of design. In this paper, we demonstrate how to analyze the security and resilience of learning-based prediction models in power distribution networks by utilizing a domain-specific deep-learning and testing framework. This framework is developed using DeepForge and enables rapid design and analysis of attack scenarios against distributed smart meters in a power distribution network. It runs the attack simulations in the cloud backend. In addition to the predictor model, we have integrated an anomaly detector to detect adversarial attacks targeting the predictor. We formulate the stealthy adversarial attacks as an optimization problem to maximize prediction loss while minimizing the required perturbations. Under the worst-case setting, where the attacker has full knowledge of both the predictor and the detector, an iterative attack method has been developed to solve for the adversarial perturbation. We demonstrate the framework capabilities using a GridLAB-D based power distribution network model and show how stealthy adversarial attacks can affect smart grid prediction systems even with a partial control of network.},

Despite their potential benefits, such technologies can have a negative impact. This subject has widely analyzed, mostly considering for-profit electric utilities. However, the literature has a gap regarding the impact of new technologies on non-profit utilities. In this work, we quantify the price of anarchy of non-profit utilities, that is, the cost caused by lack of coordination of users. We find that users, in the worst case, can consume up to twice the optimal demand, obtaining a small fraction of the optimal surplus. For this reason, we leverage the theory of mechanism design to design an incentive scheme that reduces the inefficiencies of the system, which preserves the privacy of users. We illustrate with simulations the efficiency loss of the system and show two instances of incentive mechanism that satisfy either budget balance and budget deficit.",

We show that the new cost function lowers the peaks in DR programs and design new incentive mechanisms to ensure that distributed agents converge to the Pareto-efficient solution of the system.

The goal in these systems is to design load shaping mechanisms to achieve efficiency of resources and customer satisfaction. Recent research efforts have studied the impact of integrity attacks in simplified versions of the demand response problem, where neither the load consuming agents nor the adversary are strategic.
In this paper, we study the impact of integrity attacks considering strategic players (a social planner or a consumer) and a strategic attacker. We identify two types of attackers: (1) a malicious attacker who wants to damage the equipment in the power grid by producing sudden overloads, and (2) a selfish attacker that wants to defraud the system by compromising and then manipulating control (load shaping) signals. We then explore the resiliency of two different demand response systems to these fraudsters and malicious attackers. Our results provide guidelines for system operators deciding which type of demand-response system they want to implement, how to secure them, and directions for detecting these attacks.},

abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are monitored and controlled by a wide variety of sensors and controllers. However, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that most of the devices interacting with the physical world (sensors and controllers) are extremely fragile to security incidents. One particular technology that can help us improve the trustworthiness of these devices is software attestation. While software attestation can help a verifier check the integrity of devices, it still has several drawbacks that have limited their application in the field, like establishing an authenticated channel, the inability to provide continuous attestation, and the need to modify devices to implement the attestation procedure. To overcome these limitations, we propose CPS-attestation as an attestation technique for control systems to attest their state to an external verifier. CPS-attestation enables a verifier to continuously monitor the dynamics of the control system over time and detect whether a component is not behaving as expected or if it is driving the system to an unsafe state. Our goal in this position paper is to initiate the discussion on the suitability of applying attestation techniques to control systems and the associated research challenges.},

abstract={We prove the inefficiency (in the sense of Pareto) of the electricity system, as well as its resemblance with the tragedy of the commons. Also, we present a mechanism intended to achieve efficiency in the electricity consumption by means of economic incentives. The proposed incentives might be seen as an indirect revelation mechanism, in which users do not have to reveal private information about their preferences. Instead, a particular incentive is calculated for each user, based solely on its relative consumption. We conclude that the success of the proposed mechanism requires subsidies from external institutions, at least during the transition between an inefficient outcome and the efficient equilibrium.},

 abstract={We study controllability and stability properties of dynamical systems when actuator or sensor signals are under attack. We formulate a detailed adversary model that considers different levels of privilege for the attacker such as read and write access to information flows. We then study the impact of these attacks and propose reactive countermeasures based on game theory. In one case-study we use a basic differential game, and in the other case study we introduce a heuristic game for stability.},

abstract={In this paper, the design of a population dynamics model based on both opinion and imitator dynamics is presented. This approach is focused on the analysis of some population behaviors such as the emergence of either consensus or disagreement, information aggregation, and spread of misinformation. The analysis of these properties is made in the context of network populations with or without the presence of prominent agents and environmental incentives. Some simulation results illustrate the ideas presented in this paper.},

title={Adaptive Fuzzy Equalization Based on Neuron Grouping for Time-Varying Non-Linear Channels},
author={Melgarejo, Miguel and Gaona, Andres and Barreto, Carlos},
abstract = {This paper presents an approach for time varying non-linear channel equalization based on fuzzy systems and single-neuron training. The method consists of two stages: the first one uses supervised learning in order to determine channel states and to provide an initial tuning of the fuzzy equalizer parameters. The second one dynamically adjusts the equalizer to follow the varying behavior of the channel through unsupervised learning. This proposal is compared with a radial basis network over the equalization of a time-varying communication channel reported in previous works. Experiments are carried out through Monte Carlo simulations. Results show that the proposed approach presents a performance than that of a radial basis function in terms of the bit error rate of a communication system.},
